At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas\u2014from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities\u2014that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves.\\n\\nKendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism.

The story is of the orphan Oliver Twist, who starts his life in a workhouse and is then apprenticed with an undertaker. He escapes from there and travels to London where he meets the Artful Dodger, a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets, which is led by the elderly criminal Fagin. Oliver Twist is notable for Dickens\'s unromantic portrayal of criminals and their sordid lives, as well as exposing the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid\u2013nineteenth century. The alternate title, The Parish Boy\'s Progress, alludes to Bunyan\'s The Pilgrim\'s Progress, as well as the 18th-century caricature series by William Hogarth, A Rake\'s Progress and A Harlot\'s Progress. An early example of the social novel, Dickens satirizes the hypocrisies of his time, including child labour, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens\'s own youthful experiences contributed as well. Oliver Twist has been the subject of numerous adaptations, for various media, including a highly successful musical play, Oliver!, and the multiple Academy Award winning 1968 motion picture."},{"title":"The Way of Kings (Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive)","author":"Brandon Sanderson","coverImageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517Fo8m%2BgnL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","id":"765376679","pageCount":1008,"publisher":"Tor Books","synopsis":"Roshar is a world of stone and storms.

W. Norton & Co.","synopsis":"In this \\"artful, informative, and delightful\\" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.
